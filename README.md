# Offensive Security Training Log

## Declaration

This repository documents my structured progression into offensive security.

I am currently building foundational and intermediate capability in:

* Networking fundamentals
* Operating systems (Linux focus)
* Scripting and automation
* Security fundamentals
* Hands-on lab exploitation

This is not a claim of professional status or red team authority.
It is a public record of disciplined skill acquisition.

## Purpose

The objective of this repository is to:

* Track daily structured training
* Produce tangible artifacts from every session
* Document experiments, failures, and refinements
* Build capability through execution, not passive learning

If a session produces no inspectable output, it does not count.

---

## Current Stage

Stage 1 — Foundations
Stage 2 — Lab-based exploitation practice
Stage 3 — Penetration testing depth (future)
Stage 4 — Red team–level adversary simulation (long-term objective)

This repository currently reflects Stage 1–2 development.

Progression is earned through skill, not declared through titles.

## Log Structure

Each execution day includes:

* Defined objectives
* Time-bounded deep work sessions
* Artifact creation
* Micro audit (bottlenecks, root cause, fix)
* Failure analysis (if applicable)
* End-of-day system audit

The goal is compounding capability through measurable iteration.

---

## Long-Term Direction

The long-term objective is to develop the technical depth, operational discipline, and tradecraft required for advanced offensive security and red team operations.

This log documents the path toward that level.

Capability > aesthetics.
Execution > intention.
Artifacts > effort.

## For Readers

This is a raw training archive.

Expect:

* Foundational concepts
* Lab breakdowns
* Mistakes and corrections
* Gradual technical progression

This repository grows as capability grows.
